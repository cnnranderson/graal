# Graal Reborn documentation

This repository contains miscellaneous pieces of [Graal Reborn](https://graal.in/)'s documentation. You'll be able to find helpful guides and scripting samples that should assist in setting up and managing your own Graal Server.

## Getting Started

Depending on what you're trying to accomplish, setting up a GServer tends to be the first step for most people. If you already have a server, feel free to skip down to some of the quick links and find what you're interested in.

1. You'll need the following applications to start working on a server
    - [Graal client](https://github.com/cnnranderson/graal/releases/tag/v6.0.3.7-client) - **v6.0.3.7** *(Preferred)*
      - Make sure to run the client by using `OG_Launcher.exe`. This is required to connect to Graal Reborn servers.
    - [Gs2Emu](https://github.com/cnnranderson/graal/releases/tag/v3.0.6-gs2emu) - *This is the GServer hosting application to expose a local server to the serverlist.*
    - [Remote Control](https://github.com/cnnranderson/graal/releases/tag/v2-rc) - *Otherwise known as RC2/RC3. Either version works, however, v2 has a better track record.*
2. Create an account using the [Account Creator](https://graalserver.com/accountcreator.php)
    - This allows you to login to the Graal Clients.
    - If you've lost your password, simply create your account again. Profiles are currently broken/unsupported and all that happens is it will overwrite with new credentials so you can login again.
3. Review the [GServer Setup](/docs/gserver/gserver.md) guide to continue setting up your server!
