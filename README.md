# Graal Reborn documentation

This repository contains miscellaneous pieces of [Graal Reborn](https://graal.in/)'s documentation. You'll be able to find helpful guides and scripting samples that should assist in setting up and managing your own Graal Server.

## Getting Started

Depending on what you're trying to accomplish, setting up a GServer tends to be the first step for most people. If you already have a server, feel free to skip down to some of the quick links and find what you're interested in.

1. You'll need the following applications to start working on a server
    - Graal client - **v6.0.3.7** *(Preferred)*
    - Gs2Emu - *This is the GServer hosting application to expose a local server to the serverlist*
    - Remote Control - *Otherwise known as RC2/RC3. Either version works, however, v2 has a better track record.
    - **Note: These cannot be hosted here unforutnately, and must be found via external sources to avoid potential legal conflicts. Reach out in the discord for any questions.**
2. Create an account
